# Team Principles

## Communication
- Team members will primarily communicate through a private Discord group chat.
- The chat will be used for meetings, discussing issues, and sharing ideas.
- Anyone asking a question should tag the specific team members they want a response from.
- General questions can be posed to the group at large.
- Reactions can be used to show approval or disapproval of messages, and may also serve as quick polls in the chat for larger group decisions.
- Team members are expected to inform the group at least 24 hours in advance through the chat if they will be absent from online or in-person meetings.

## Meetings
- A designated note-taker will record meeting minutes, with the role rotating each time to ensure fairness.
- Meetings will be led by the team leader, or by another group member if the leader is absent, and the meeting lead must have a clear plan prepared in advance.
- We will hold regular online meetings for our team members every Monday at 3PM EST.
- Members are responsible for attending the team meetings – if they are not able to make it, they must let the other attendees know at least 24 hours in advance.
- If a member misses a meeting, they are responsible for updating the team in the chat and catching up on any missed discussions.

## Work Delegation
- We are all committed to supporting each other with the work for this course.
  - Tasks will be divided equitably among team members.
  - Individual workloads from other courses and assignments will be considered when distributing responsibilities.
  - Work will also be allocated according to each member’s skills and strengths to ensure efficiency and fairness.
- The delegated work will be recorded using GitHub issues.
- Members should promptly inform the team if a task is taking longer or is more difficult than expected.
- Work should be completed with enough time for others to review and provide feedback.
- Last-minute submissions should be avoided, as they make collaboration and discussion difficult.

## Other issues
- Disagreements should be discussed respectfully as a team, either during meetings or asynchronously in the chat, to resolve issues constructively.
- Larger or more sensitive issues can be addressed through one-on-one conversations between those involved, with the goal of de-escalating conflicts. 
- The team is committed to coming up with a plan to overcome roadblocks of any kind through shared communication on how to handle the issue.
